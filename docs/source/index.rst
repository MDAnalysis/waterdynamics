Welcome to waterdynamics's documentation!
=========================================================

This package provides classes and functions for the analysis of water dynamics and water interactions with other molecules in molecular simulations. The functions in this package are: water orientational relaxation (WOR) :footcite:p:`Yeh1999`, hydrogen bond lifetimes (HBL) :footcite:p:`Rapaport1983`, angular distribution (AD) :footcite:p:`Grigera1995`, mean square displacement (MSD) :footcite:p:`Brodka1994`, and survival probability (SP) :footcite:p:`Liu2004`.

For more information about this type of analysis please refer to
:footcite:p:`ArayaSecchi2014` (water in a protein cavity) and
:footcite:p:`Milischuk2011` (water in a nanopore).
